This repo contains all the sketches I made during the writing of Programming the iPhone User Experience.

The code is not polished, vetted, or recommended for any production use. Rather, it's illustrative and
casual â€“ very "sketchy" by definition. 

Use anything here written by me for any purpose, but no warranty is provided or implied. Some of the Apple
sample code likely made it into this folder as well.
